  /// non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines

  /// - "ABORTED" : The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
  /// issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the

  /// - "OUT_OF_RANGE" : The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g.,
  /// seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
  /// indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For
  /// example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to
  /// read at an offset that is not in the range \[0,2^32-1\], but it will
  /// generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current

  /// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space
  /// can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.
