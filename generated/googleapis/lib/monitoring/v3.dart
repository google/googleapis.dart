/// the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of

/// divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all
/// of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical
/// transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and
/// converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the
/// aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the
/// number of time series through similar mathematical transformations.
/// Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series,
/// optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and
/// applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a
/// huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction
/// transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative
