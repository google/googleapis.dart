/// An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

///
/// A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
/// `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service
/// accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named
/// list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a
/// user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a
/// `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
/// allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
/// condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
/// resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
/// policies, see the
/// [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
/// **JSON example:** { "bindings": \[ { "role":
/// "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": \[
/// "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
/// "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" \] }, { "role":
