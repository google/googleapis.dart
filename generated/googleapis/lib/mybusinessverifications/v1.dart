/// (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via
/// user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of
/// process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address
/// widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not
/// be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside
/// countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this
/// schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478

  /// Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
  /// sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. "Austin, TX"),
  /// it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines
  /// should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In
  /// places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make
  /// it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en"
  /// for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be
  /// selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural
  /// representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining
  /// information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format
  /// such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic
  /// reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was
