/// KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index.

/// indicating if the range includes rows with that key. Keys are represented by
/// lists, where the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of
/// the table or index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described
/// here. For example, consider the following table definition: CREATE TABLE
/// UserEvents ( UserName STRING(MAX), EventDate STRING(10) ) PRIMARY
/// KEY(UserName, EventDate); The following keys name rows in this table: "Bob",
/// "2014-09-23" Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two
/// columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the
/// `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`. Key ranges with multiple
/// components are interpreted lexicographically by component using the table or
/// index key's declared sort order. For example, the following range returns
/// all events for user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year 2015: "start_closed":
/// \["Bob", "2015-01-01"\] "end_closed": \["Bob", "2015-12-31"\] Start and end
/// keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the inclusion and
/// exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key components: if the key
/// is closed, then rows that exactly match the provided components are
/// included; if the key is open, then rows that exactly match are not included.
/// For example, the following range includes all events for `"Bob"` that
/// occurred during and after the year 2000: "start_closed": \["Bob",
/// "2000-01-01"\] "end_closed": \["Bob"\] The next example retrieves all events
/// for `"Bob"`: "start_closed": \["Bob"\] "end_closed": \["Bob"\] To retrieve
/// events before the year 2000: "start_closed": \["Bob"\] "end_open": \["Bob",
/// "2000-01-01"\] The following range includes all rows in the table:
/// "start_closed": \[\] "end_closed": \[\] This range returns all users whose
/// `UserName` begins with any character from A to C: "start_closed": \["A"\]
/// "end_open": \["D"\] This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins
/// with B: "start_closed": \["B"\] "end_open": \["C"\] Key ranges honor column
/// sort order. For example, suppose a table is defined as follows: CREATE TABLE
/// DescendingSortedTable { Key INT64, ... ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC); The
/// following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and 100
/// inclusive: "start_closed": \["100"\] "end_closed": \["1"\] Note that 100 is

/// Transactions: Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time

///
/// After the active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
/// re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a new
/// session for each transaction. Transaction Modes: Cloud Spanner supports
/// three transaction modes: 1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is
/// the only way to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
/// pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit. Locking read-write
/// transactions may abort, requiring the application to retry. 2. Snapshot
/// read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed consistency across
/// several reads, but does not allow writes. Snapshot read-only transactions
/// can be configured to read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
/// transactions do not need to be committed. 3. Partitioned DML. This type of
/// transaction is used to execute a single Partitioned DML statement.
/// Partitioned DML partitions the key space and runs the DML statement over
/// each partition in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
/// independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be committed. For
/// transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions provide simpler
/// semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-only
/// transactions do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write
/// transactions. As a consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort,
/// so retry loops are not needed. Transactions may only read/write data in a
/// single database. They may, however, read/write data in different tables
/// within that database. Locking Read-Write Transactions: Locking transactions
/// may be used to atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a database.
/// This type of transaction is externally consistent. Clients should attempt to
/// minimize the amount of time a transaction is active. Faster transactions
/// commit with higher probability and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner
/// attempts to keep read locks active as long as the transaction continues to
/// do reads, and the transaction has not been terminated by Commit or Rollback.
/// Long periods of inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release
/// a transaction's locks and abort it. Conceptually, a read-write transaction
/// consists of zero or more reads or SQL statements followed by Commit. At any
/// time before Commit, the client can send a Rollback request to abort the
/// transaction. Semantics: Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read
/// locks it acquired are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire
/// write locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
/// reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that
/// the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner. Unless the
/// transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the
/// transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks
/// for any sort of mutual exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner
/// transactions themselves. Retrying Aborted Transactions: When a transaction
/// aborts, the application can choose to retry the whole transaction again. To
/// maximize the chances of successfully committing the retry, the client should
/// execute the retry in the same session as the original attempt. The original
/// session's lock priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that
/// each attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
/// Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to modify the
/// same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a short period before
/// successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of
/// retries a transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total
/// amount of wall time spent retrying. Idle Transactions: A transaction is
/// considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not
/// started a read or SQL query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions
/// can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks
/// indefinitely. In that case, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`. If
/// this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in
/// the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
/// idle. Snapshot Read-Only Transactions: Snapshot read-only transactions
/// provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
/// several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
/// writes. Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
/// choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
/// timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent
/// read-write transactions. Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot
/// read-only transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
/// timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection
/// policy is generous enough that most applications do not need to worry about
/// this in practice. Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call Commit
/// or Rollback (and in fact are not permitted to do so). To execute a snapshot
/// transaction, the client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells Cloud
/// Spanner how to choose a read timestamp. The types of timestamp bound are: -
/// Strong (the default). - Bounded staleness. - Exact staleness. If the Cloud
/// Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed, stale read-only
/// transactions can execute more quickly than strong or read-write transaction,
/// because they are able to execute far from the leader replica. Each type of
/// timestamp bound is discussed in detail below. Strong: Strong reads are
/// guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that have committed before
/// the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows yielded by a single read are
/// consistent with each other -- if any part of the read observes a
/// transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction. Strong reads are not
/// repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only transactions might return
/// inconsistent results if there are concurrent writes. If consistency across
/// reads is required, the reads should be executed within a transaction or at
/// an exact read timestamp. See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong. Exact
/// Staleness: These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
/// timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of
/// the global transaction history: they observe modifications done by all
/// transactions with a commit timestamp <= the read timestamp, and observe none
/// of the modifications done by transactions with a larger commit timestamp.
/// They will block until all conflicting transactions that may be assigned
/// commit timestamps <= the read timestamp have finished. The timestamp can
/// either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a
/// staleness relative to the current time. These modes do not require a
/// "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly
/// faster than the equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other
/// hand, boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results. See
/// TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
/// TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness. Bounded Staleness: Bounded
/// staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
/// user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
/// within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
/// available replica without blocking. All rows yielded are consistent with
/// each other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of
/// the read see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two
/// stale reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
/// different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results. Boundedly stale
/// reads execute in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among
/// all replicas needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are
/// executed at the negotiated timestamp. As a result of the two phase
/// execution, bounded staleness reads are usually a little slower than
/// comparable exact staleness reads. However, they are typically able to return
/// fresher results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
/// Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows
/// will be read, it can only be used with single-use read-only transactions.
/// See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
/// TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp. Old Read Timestamps and
/// Garbage Collection: Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and
/// overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is
/// known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
/// are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at
/// read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This restriction also
/// applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become too
/// old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old read timestamps fail
/// with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. Partitioned DML Transactions:
/// Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
/// different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
/// scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
/// ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
/// should prefer using ReadWrite transactions. Partitioned DML partitions the
/// keyspace and runs the DML statement on each partition in separate, internal
/// transactions. These transactions commit automatically when complete, and run
/// independently from one another. To reduce lock contention, this execution
/// strategy only acquires read locks on rows that match the WHERE clause of the
/// statement. Additionally, the smaller per-partition transactions hold locks
/// for less time. That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for
/// standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions. - The DML statement must be
/// fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement must be expressible as the
/// union of many statements which each access only a single row of the table. -
/// The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
/// the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
/// independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically with
/// the base table rows. - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once
/// execution semantics against a partition. The statement will be applied at
/// least once to each partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML
/// statement should be idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it
/// is potentially dangerous to run a statement such as `UPDATE table SET column
/// = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times against some rows. - The
/// partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for Commit or
/// Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing the
/// ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
/// executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was never
/// executed against other rows. - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain
/// the execution of a single DML statement via ExecuteSql or
/// ExecuteStreamingSql. - If any error is encountered during the execution of
/// the partitioned DML operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation,
/// division by zero, or a value that cannot be stored due to schema
/// constraints), then the operation is stopped at that point and an error is
/// returned. It is possible that at this point, some partitions have been
/// committed (or even committed multiple times), and other partitions have not
/// been run at all. Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large,
/// database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows
/// from a very large table.
