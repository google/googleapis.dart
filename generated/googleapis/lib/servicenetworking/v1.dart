/// # gRPC Transcoding gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC
/// method and one or more HTTP REST endpoints.
///
/// It allows developers to build a single API service that supports both gRPC
/// APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including
/// [Google APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
/// [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints),
/// [gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and
/// [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature and
/// use it for large scale production services. `HttpRule` defines the schema of
/// the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies how different portions of the
/// gRPC request message are mapped to the URL path, URL query parameters, and
/// HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC response message is mapped
/// to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is typically specified as an
/// `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method. Each mapping specifies a
/// URL path template and an HTTP method. The path template may refer to one or
/// more fields in the gRPC request message, as long as each field is a
/// non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type. The path template
/// controls how fields of the request message are mapped to the URL path.
/// Example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns
/// (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/{name=messages / * }" };
/// } } message GetMessageRequest { string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path. }
/// message Message { string text = 1; // The resource content. } This enables
/// an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
/// /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")` Any fields in
/// the request message which are not bound by the path template automatically
/// become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example:
/// service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
/// option (google.api.http) = { get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}" }; } } message
/// GetMessageRequest { message SubMessage { string subfield = 1; } string
/// message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path. int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL
/// query parameter `revision`. SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query
/// parameter `sub.subfield`. } This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as
/// below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
/// /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id:
/// "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))` Note that fields
/// which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a primitive type or a
/// repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type. In the case of a
/// repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL as
/// `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
/// message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
/// `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`. For HTTP methods that allow a request body,
/// the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
/// message resource collection: service Messaging { rpc
/// UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
/// (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "message" };
/// } } message UpdateMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; // mapped to the
/// URL Message message = 2; // mapped to the body } The following HTTP JSON to
/// RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the JSON in the request
/// body is determined by protos JSON encoding: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH
/// /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456"
/// message { text: "Hi!" })` The special name `*` can be used in the body
/// mapping to define that every field not bound by the path template should be
/// mapped to the request body. This enables the following alternative
/// definition of the update method: service Messaging { rpc
/// UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = {
/// patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "*" }; } } message Message { string
/// message_id = 1; string text = 2; } The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is
/// enabled: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!"
/// }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")` Note that when using
/// `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all
/// fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more
/// rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is
/// in custom methods which don't use the URL at all for transferring data. It
/// is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the
/// `additional_bindings` option. Example: service Messaging { rpc
/// GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) =
/// { get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" additional_bindings { get:
/// "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}" } }; } } message
/// GetMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; string user_id = 2; } This
/// enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings: HTTP | gRPC
/// -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
/// `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:

/// categories: - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the
/// URL path. - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the
/// HTTP request body. - All other fields are passed via the URL query
/// parameters, and the parameter name is the field path in the request message.
/// A repeated field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the
/// same name. 2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all
/// fields are passed via URL path and HTTP request body. 3. If HttpRule.body is
/// omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all fields are passed via URL path
/// and URL query parameters. ### Path template syntax Template = "/" Segments
/// \[ Verb \] ; Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ; Segment = "*" | "**" |
/// LITERAL | Variable ; Variable = "{" FieldPath \[ "=" Segments \] "}" ;
/// FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ; Verb = ":" LITERAL ; The syntax `*`
/// matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or more URL
/// path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path except the
/// `Verb`. The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by
/// its template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a
/// variable matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g.
/// `{var}` is equivalent to `{var=*}`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal
/// text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL` contains any reserved character, such
/// characters should be percent-encoded before the matching. If a variable
/// contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or `"{var=*}"`, when
/// such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client side, all
/// characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side
/// does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
/// [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis)
/// as `{var}`. If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as
/// `"{var=foo / * }"` or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a
/// URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are
/// percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and
/// "%2f" are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the
/// [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis)
/// as `{+var}`. ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration gRPC API Service
/// Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for configuring a
/// gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service config is simply
/// the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service` proto message. As an
/// alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
/// transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
/// `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
/// effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you have
/// a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
/// specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
/// configuration in the proto. Example: http: rules: # Selects a gRPC method
/// and applies HttpRule to it. - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage get:
/// /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield} ## Special notes When gRPC
/// Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to JSON
/// conversion must follow the
/// [proto3 specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
/// While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
/// [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
/// Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
/// 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion does not
/// expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead to invalid
/// URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding for multi
/// segment variables. The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or
/// mapped field, because client libraries are not capable of handling such
/// variable expansion. The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/"
/// character. The reason is that the most common use case "{var}" does not
/// capture the leading "/" character. For consistency, all path variables must
/// share the same behavior. Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL
/// query parameters, because no client library can support such complicated
/// mapping. If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body,
/// it can map the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some
/// gRPC Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

  /// should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be
  /// computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). *
  /// `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples,
  /// `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression =
  /// Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( \[ PREFIX \]
  /// UNIT | "%" ) \[ Annotation \] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME
  /// "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If
  /// the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For
  /// examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a
  /// sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or
  /// `}`. * `1` represents a unitary
  /// [dimensionless unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity)
  /// of 1, such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units
  /// are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as
  /// `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users).
  /// Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as
  /// `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would
  /// mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value of
  /// 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are
  /// typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3
  /// percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in
  /// the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a
  /// percentage (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").
