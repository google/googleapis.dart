  /// Determines whether the specified (directional) relationship exists between

  ///
  /// The relation describes the intent of the link between the two assets as
  /// claimed by the source asset. An example for such relationships is the
  /// delegation of privileges or permissions. This command is most often used
  /// by infrastructure systems to check preconditions for an action. For
  /// example, a client may want to know if it is OK to send a web URL to a
  /// particular mobile app instead. The client can check for the relevant asset
  /// link from the website to the mobile app to decide if the operation should
  /// be allowed. A note about security: if you specify a secure asset as the
  /// source, such as an HTTPS website or an Android app, the API will ensure
  /// that any statements used to generate the response have been made in a
  /// secure way by the owner of that asset. Conversely, if the source asset is
  /// an insecure HTTP website (that is, the URL starts with `http://` instead
  /// of `https://`), the API cannot verify its statements securely, and it is
  /// not possible to ensure that the website's statements have not been altered
  /// by a third party. For more information, see the
  /// [Digital Asset Links technical design specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/details.md).

  /// that describes the specific use case of the statement. Refer to \[our API
  /// documentation\](/digital-asset-links/v1/relation-strings) for the current
  /// list of supported relations. For a query to match an asset link, both the
  /// query's and the asset link's relation strings must match exactly. Example:
