/// `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
/// allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
/// condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
/// resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
/// policies, see the
