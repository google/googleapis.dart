/// Policy Simulator API - v1
///
/// Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
/// viewing a Replay. A `Replay` is a type of simulation that lets you see how
/// your members' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM
/// policy. During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past
/// access attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and
/// compares those results to determine how your members' access might change
/// under the proposed policy.
///
/// For more information, see
/// <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/simulating-access>

/// A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
/// `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user
/// accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A
/// `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined
/// role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud
/// resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical
/// expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
/// to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
/// request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions
/// in their IAM policies, see the
/// [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
/// **JSON example:** { "bindings": \[ { "role":
/// "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": \[
