Provides support for obtaining OAuth2 credentials to access Google APIs.

This package also provides convenience functionality for:
- obtaining authenticated HTTP clients
- automatically refreshing OAuth2 credentials

### Using this package

Using this package requires creating a Google Cloud Project and obtaining
application credentials for the specific application type.
The steps required are:

- Create a new Google Cloud Project on the
  [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
- Enable all APIs that the application will use on the
  [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
  (under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> APIs)
- Obtain application credentials for a specific application type on the
  [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
  (under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> Credentials)
- Use the `googleapis_auth` package to obtain access credentials /
  obtain an authenticated HTTP client.

Depending on the application type, there are different ways to achieve the
third and fourth step. The following is a list of supported OAuth2 flows with
a description of these two steps.


#### Client-side Web Application

For client-side only web applications a "Client ID" needs to be created
(under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> Credentials). When
creating a new client ID, select the "Web application" type. For client-side
only applications, no `Redirect URIs` are necessary. The `Javascript Origins`
setting must be set to all URLs on which your application
will be served (e.g. http://localhost:8080 for local testing).


After the Client Id has been created, you can obtain access credentials via
```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_browser.dart";

...

var id = ClientId("....apps.googleusercontent.com", null);
var scopes = [...];

// Initialize the browser oauth2 flow functionality.
createImplicitBrowserFlow(id, scopes).then((BrowserOAuth2Flow flow) {
  flow.obtainAccessCredentialsViaUserConsent()
      .then((AccessCredentials credentials) {
    // Credentials are available in [credentials].
    ...
    flow.close();
  });
});
```

or obtain an authenticated HTTP client via
```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_browser.dart";

...

var id = ClientId("....apps.googleusercontent.com", null);
var scopes = [...];

// Initialize the browser oauth2 flow functionality.
createImplicitBrowserFlow(id, scopes).then((BrowserOAuth2Flow flow) {
  flow.clientViaUserConsent().then((AuthClient client) {
    // Authenticated and auto refreshing client is available in [client].
    ...
    client.close();
    flow.close();
  });
});
```

To prevent popup blockers from blocking the user authorization dialog, the
methods `obtainAccessCredentialsViaUserConsent` and `clientViaUserConsent`
should preferably only be called inside an event handler, since most browsers
do not block popup windows created in response to a user interaction.

The authenticated HTTP client can now access data on behalf a user for the
requested oauth2 scopes.


#### Installed/Console Application

For installed/console applications a "Client ID" needs to be created
(under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> Credentials). When
creating a new client ID, select the "Installed application -> Other" type.

The redirect URIs for the automatic and manual flow will be configured
automatically.

After the Client Id has been created, you can obtain access credentials via
```dart
import "package:http/http.dart" as http;
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

...

var id = ClientId("....apps.googleusercontent.com", "...");
var scopes = [...];

var client = http.Client();
obtainAccessCredentialsViaUserConsent(id, scopes, client, prompt)
    .then((AccessCredentials credentials) {
  // Access credentials are available in [credentials].
  // ...
  client.close();
});

void prompt(String url) {
  print("Please go to the following URL and grant access:");
  print("  => $url");
  print("");
}
```

or obtain an authenticated HTTP client via

```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

...

var id = ClientId("....apps.googleusercontent.com", "...");
var scopes = [...];

clientViaUserConsent(id, scopes, prompt).then((AuthClient client) {
  // Authenticated and auto refreshing client is available in [client].
  // ...
  client.close();
});

void prompt(String url) {
  print("Please go to the following URL and grant access:");
  print("  => $url");
  print("");
}
```

In case of misconfigured browsers/proxies or other issues, it is also possible
to use a manual flow via `obtainAccessCredentialsViaUserConsentManual` and
`clientViaUserConsentManual`. But in this case the `prompt` function needs to
complete with a `Future<String>` which contains the "authorization code".
The user obtains the "authorization code" (which is a string of characters) in
a browser and needs to copy & paste it to the application. (The prompt function
should block until it has gotten the "authorization code" from the user.)

The authenticated HTTP client can now access data on behalf a user for the
requested oauth2 scopes.


#### Autonomous Application / Service Account

If an application wants to act autonomously and access e.g. data from a Google
Cloud Project, then a Service Account can be created. In this case no user
authorization is involved.

A service account can be created via the "Service account" application type
when creating a Client ID
(under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> Credentials). It will download
a JSON document which contains a private RSA key. That private key is used for
obtaining access credentials.

After the service account was created, you can obtain access credentials via
```dart
import "package:http/http.dart" as http;
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

var accountCredentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.fromJson({
  "private_key_id": "<please fill in>",
  "private_key": "<please fill in>",
  "client_email": "<please fill in>@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<please fill in>.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "type": "service_account"
});
var scopes = [...];

...

var client = http.Client();
obtainAccessCredentialsViaServiceAccount(accountCredentials, scopes, client)
    .then((AccessCredentials credentials) {
  // Access credentials are available in [credentials].
  // ...
  client.close();
});
```

or an authenticated HTTP client via

```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

final accountCredentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.fromJson({
  "private_key_id": "<please fill in>",
  "private_key": "<please fill in>",
  "client_email": "<please fill in>@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<please fill in>.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "type": "service_account"
});
var scopes = [...];

...

clientViaServiceAccount(accountCredentials, scopes).then((AuthClient client) {
  // [client] is an authenticated HTTP client.
  // ...
  client.close();
});
```

The authenticated HTTP client can now access APIs.

##### Impersonation

For some APIs the use of a service account also requires to impersonate a
user. To support that the `ServiceAccountCredentials` constructors have an
optional argument `impersonatedUser` to specify the user to impersonate.

One example of this are the Google Apps APIs. See
[Perform Google Apps Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation)
for information on the additional security configuration required to enable this
for a service account.

#### Autonomous Application / Compute Engine using metadata service

If an application wants to act autonomously and access e.g. data from a Google
Cloud Project, then a Service Account can be used. In case the application is
running on a ComputeEngine VM it is possible to start a VM with a set of scopes
the VM is allowed to use. See the
[documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#using)
for further information.

Here is an example of using the metadata service for obtaining access
credentials on a ComputeEngine VM.
```dart
import "package:http/http.dart" as http;
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

var client = http.Client();
obtainAccessCredentialsViaMetadataServer(client)
    .then((AccessCredentials credentials) {
  // Access credentials are available in [credentials].
  // ...
  client.close();
});
```

or an authenticated HTTP client via

```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

clientViaMetadataServer().then((AuthClient client) {
  // [client] is an authenticated HTTP client.
  // ...
  client.close();
});
```
The authenticated HTTP client can now access APIs.


#### Accessing Public Data with API Key

It is possible to access some APIs by just using an API key without OAuth2.

A API key can be obtained on the Google Developers Console by creating a Key
at the "Public API access" section
(under DevConsole -> Project -> APIs & auth -> Credentials).

A key can be created for different application types: For browser applications
it is necessary to specify a set of referer URls from which the application
would like to access APIs. For server applications it is possible to specify
a list of IP ranges from which the client application would like to access APIs.

Note that the ApiKey is used for quota and billing purposes and should not be
disclosed to third parties.

Here is an example of getting an HTTP client which uses an API key for making
HTTP requests.

```dart
import "package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart";

var client = clientViaApiKey('<api-key-from-devconsole>');
// [client] can now be used to make REST calls to Google APIs.
// ...
client.close();
```
